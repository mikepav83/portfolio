		<p>Pizza is quite possibly one of the most delicious and simplest foods ever made. For those who don't know, pizza is an Italian dish created by Italian immigrants in the late ninteenth century. It is made in various shapes of flattened dough with a layer of tomato sauce then topped with cheese, and various ingredients of the chef's choosing. America's first pizzeria, Lombardi's opened in 1905 in New York's Little Italy. Following the end of World War II, soldiers returning from their tour of duty in Italy proved there was a strong market for a dish like pizza after having eaten Italian cuisine overseas. Since then pizza has become an immensely popular dish in America. Pizza chains like Domino's, Pizza Hut, California Pizza Kitchen, Marco's Pizza, Papa Murphy's, Little Caesers, Papa John's, and others have capitalized on the dishes popularity in consumption and as a result, have opened multiple franchises all over America with great success. Even supermarkets are cashing in with freshly prepared pizzas ready to go in your oven.</p>


		<p>Pizzas in restaurants are traditionally prepared fresh then cooked in either an oven with stone bricks above the heat source, an electric oven, wood or a coal-fired brick oven. On so called deck ovens, pizza can be slid into the oven on a long metal or wooden paddle, called a peel, and baked directly on the hot bricks or baked on a screen which is a round metal grate. In order to prevent the pizza from falling apart, the peel is sprinkled with cornmeal in order to allow the pizza to easily slide onto and off of it. Other varieties of pizza such as: Chicago-style deep-dish pizza and Greek pizza are baked in a pan rather than on the bricks of an oven. This is due to the variances in the crust.</p>


		<p>The month of October is designated as National Pizza Month in America. In October 1984 pizzeria owner Gerry Durnell, the founder of Pizza Today magazine, chose this particular month because the first issue of his magazine debuted in October of that year. Fans of the dish celebrate by consuming copious amounts of pizzas. Some pizzerias even give away free pizza slices or discount promotions in celebration of the holiday. Special pizzas not routinely on the menu are offered for a limited time as well.</p>
